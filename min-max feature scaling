""" quiz materials for feature scaling clustering """

### FYI, the most straightforward implementation might 
### throw a divide-by-zero error, if the min and max
### values are the same
### but think about this for a second--that means that every
### data point has the same value for that feature!  
### why would you rescale it?  Or even use it at all?
def featureScaling(arr):
    xmin=arr[0]
    xmax=arr[2]
    xprime=arr[1]
    nume=xprime-xmin
    denom=xmax-xmin
    

    return nume/denom

# tests of your feature scaler--line below is input data
data = [115, 140, 175]
